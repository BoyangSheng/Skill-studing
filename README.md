# Skill-studying

This repository is for everyone to study some skills often used in the field of IT as well as modeling. Most of the Markdown files will write in Chinese (if some one need English version please contact me), and all the codes mentioned in the markdown files will be here in the sub-files. 

Some skill include:

- Julia language for green hands
- Usage of Markdown files
- Zotero (Application for documentation)
- Coming soon...

Good luck!
